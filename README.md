# 🔥 Firewall Role in a Network

This project focuses on securing a multi-department office network by zoning it into distinct areas based on departmental functions. Each zone is protected by dedicated firewalls to ensure secure and controlled communication between departments. This architecture enhances overall network security and safeguards the organization’s infrastructure from potential threats.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Design and implementation of network zoning for a multi-department office
- Deployment of firewalls to isolate and protect departmental zones
- Controlled communication and data flow between zones via firewall policies
- Enhanced protection against unauthorized access and cyber threats
- Visualized network topology and firewall placement

## 📄 How to Use

1. Open the `project (5).pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer to explore the network setup.
2. Review the firewall configurations applied between departmental zones.
3. Use the diagrams (`.png` files) to understand network topology and zoning.
4. Test network communication to verify firewall policies and security.
